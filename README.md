# WTCurve

A trash-editor for bezier curves. [http://wtcurve.surge.sh](http://wtcurve.surge.sh)

What's a trash-editor? It's an editor, but like.. you made it without really looking at the screen. Don't read the code.. it is an embarrassment to its family. But you can like.. use it to make the cool thing that you make. It's like using your bike chain to lift furniture through the second storey window. Or it's like looking for love on kijiji. Okay, it's not like that.
